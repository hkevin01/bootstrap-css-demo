# Development Workflow

## Branching Strategy
- Use `main` for production-ready code.
- Feature branches: `feature/<name>`
- Bugfix branches: `bugfix/<name>`
- Pull requests required for merging.

## CI/CD Pipelines
- Automated tests on push and PRs.
- Build and deploy on merge to `main`.

## Code Review
- All code changes require review.
- Use GitHub PRs for discussion and approval.
